# Requirements
[X] The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.

[X] The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.

[X] The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least **one has-many relationship**. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments.

[X] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at least **3** AJAX calls, 
covering **at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)**. Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.
